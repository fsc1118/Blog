    <h1>Database Isolation</h1>
    <h2>
        Weak Isolation
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Read Uncommitted
    </h3>
    <p>
        Read uncommitted is the weakest isolation level. It allows a transaction to read data that has not been
        committed.
        This means that a transaction can read data that has not been committed by other transactions. This can lead to
        dirty reads (read uncommitted value) and dirty writes (write to uncommited data).
    </p>
    <h3>
        Read Committed
    </h3>
    <p>
        Read committed is the second weakest isolation level.
    <h6>
        The following is copied from Martin Kleppmann's book "Designing Data-Intensive Applications".
    </h6>
    It makes two guarantees: <br />
    1. When reading from the database, you will only see data that has been committed
    (no dirty reads). <br />
    2. When writing to the database, you will only overwrite data that has been committed (no dirty writes).
    <br />
    <h4>Implementing Read Committed</h4>
    <h5>Prevent Dirty Write</h5>
    <p>
        Attempting to write to a row requires to acquire a lock on that row. If the row is locked, the transaction will
        wait. If transaction acquires the lock, it will hold it until the transaction commits or aborts.
    </p>
    <h5>Prevent Dirty Read</h5>
    <p>
        For every object that is written, the database remembers both the old committed value and the new value set by
        the transaction that currently holds the write
        lock. While the transaction is ongoing, any other transactions that read the object are
        simply given the old value. Only when the new value is committed do transactions
        switch over to reading the new value.

    <h3>
        Repeatable Read (Snapshot Isolation)
    </h3>
    <p>
        Snapshot isolation ensures that a transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database for the duration of
        its execution.
    </p>
    <image src="./Snapshot isolation.png"></image>
    <p>
        Assuming a person has 2 accounts, A and B. The person has 500 in A and 500 in B. The person wants to
        transfer 100 from A to B. At the same time, the person is watching the balance of A and B.<br />
        Let's see T1 is the transaction to transfer 100 from A to B and T2 is the transaction to watch the balance of A
        and B.
        <br />
        T2 firstly reads balance of A and its balance is 500. Then T1 starts to transfer 100 from A to B. T2 then
        resumes to check balance B, finding it becomes 600.
        <br />
        This is problematic because it causes inconsistency. Assume there is a backup process running, it may lead to
        inconsistent state of the database to be backed up.
        <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Snapshot isolation solves this problem by taking a snapshot of the database at the beginning of the transaction
        and using that snapshot for the duration of the transaction. <br />
        In the above example, T2 takes a snapshot (SnapshotA) of the database at the beginning of the transaction and
        reads from SnapshotA. <br />
        T1 then starts by creating SnapshotB to transfer 100 from A to B, and all the update happen only in SnapshotB.
        <br>
        T2 then resumes to check balance B from the SnapshotA, finding it is still 500.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can be described as follows: <br />
        1. At the start of each transaction, the database makes a list of all the other transactions that are in
        progress (not yet committed or aborted) at that time. Any writes
        that those transactions have made are ignored, even if the transactions subsequently commit.<br>
        2. Any writes made by aborted transactions are ignored.<br />
        3. Any writes made by transactions with a later transaction ID (i.e., which started
        after the current transaction started) are ignored, regardless of whether those
        transactions have committed.<br />
        4. All other writes are visible to the application’s queries.<br />
        5. If a transaction deletes a row, the row isn’t actually deleted from the
        database, but it is marked for deletion by setting the deleted_by field to the ID of the
        transaction that requested the deletion. At some later time, when it is certain that no
        transaction can any longer access the deleted data, a garbage collection process in the
        database removes any rows marked for deletion and frees their space.

    <h2>
        Serializable Isolation
    </h2>
    <p>
        Serializable isolation ensures the result of several transactions running concurrently is the same as if they
        were run sequentially.<br />
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why Serializable Isolation
    </h3>
    <p>
        Write skew is a problem that can occur when two transactions are updating the same data at the same time. <br />
        For example, assume there is a table with 2 columns, id and balance. <br />
        Transaction1 and Transaction2 are both increasing the balance of a row with id=1 by 100. <br />
        Transaction1 reads the balance of id=1, which is 500. <br />
        Transaction2 reads the balance of id=1, which is 500. <br />
        Transaction1 then writes 600 to the balance of id=1. <br />
        Transaction2 then writes 600 to the balance of id=1. <br />
        The final balance of id=1 is 600, which is wrong. <br />
    </p>

        Different implementation of Serializable Isolation. How serializable isolation solves write skew
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Stored Procedures
    </h4>
    <p>
        Stored procedures are a way to encapsulate a set of SQL statements into a single unit. <br />
        The database will execute the stored procedure as a single unit, which means that the database will lock the
        entire table while the stored procedure is running. <br />
        This prevents write skew from happening. <br />
        However, this is not a good solution because it is not scalable. <br />
        If there are 1000 transactions, the database will lock the entire table for 1000 times. <br />
    </p>
    <h4>
        Two Phase Locking and predicate locking
    </h4>
    <p>
        In read committed and snapshot isolation, the database locks the row that is being writtent, but read isn't
        affected. <br />
        Two Phase Lock works as follow: <br />
        • If a transaction wants to read an object, it must first acquire the lock in shared
        mode. Several transactions are allowed to hold the lock in shared mode simultaneously, but if another
        transaction already has an exclusive lock on the object,
        these transactions must wait.
        <br>
        • If a transaction wants to write to an object, it must first acquire the lock in exclu‐
        sive mode. No other transaction may hold the lock at the same time (either in
        shared or in exclusive mode), so if there is any existing lock on the object, the
        transaction must wait.
        <br />
        • If a transaction first reads and then writes an object, it may upgrade its shared
        lock to an exclusive lock. The upgrade works the same as getting an exclusive
        lock directly.
        <br />
        • After a transaction has acquired the lock, it must continue to hold the lock until
        the end of the transaction (commit or abort). This is where the name “twophase” comes from: the first phase
        (while the transaction is executing) is when
        the locks are acquired, and the second phase (at the end of the transaction) is
        when all the locks are released.
        <br />
        • The database automatically detects deadlocks between transactions and
        aborts one of them so that the others can make progress.
        <br />
    <p>
        A deadlock senario:<br />
        Two transactions, T1 and T2, are initially both reading, so they have shared lock <br />
        Then both T1 and T2 want to write, so they both need to upgrade their shared lock to exclusive lock. <br />
        However, neither T1 nor T2 can upgrade their shared lock to exclusive lock because the other one already has an
        sharded lock.
    </p>
    <br />
    ---- Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data-Intensive Applications
    <p>
        Predicate locking is a way to lock a subset of rows in a table. <br />
        For example, if a transaction wants to update the balance of all the rows with id=1, the database will lock all
        the rows with id=1. <br />
        This, in combination with two phase locking, can solve write skew. <br />
        Again, assuming T1 and T2 are both increasing the balance of a row with id=1 by 100. <br />
        T1 reads the balance of id=1, which is 500, acquiring the shared lock <br />
        T2 reads the balance of id=1, which is 500, acquiring the shared lock <br />
        Then T1 and T2 will be in deadlock, as described above. <br />
        Therefore, one of them will be aborted, and the other one will be able to write to the balance of id=1. <br />
        This prevents write skew from happening. <br />
    </p>
    </p>
    <h4>
        Serializable Snapshot Isolation
    </h4>
    <p>
        This is an optimistic concurrency control method. <br />
        This lets concurrent transaction run, only aborting the transaction when inconsistency is detected. <br />
        This works well if inconsistency is rare. <br />
    </p>
    <h5>
        How Serializable Snapshot Isolation works
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Detecting when a transaction reads outdated values</li>
        <li>Detecting when one transaction modifies
            another transaction’s reads.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When a database detects that a transaction A is reading outdated values updated by transaction B, it aborts that
        transaction A when it
        commits if it then
        writes and if transaction B has commited.
        <br>
        This is because if the transaction is read only, it doesn't matter if it reads outdated values since it will not
        cause inconsistency. <br />
        Also, if transaction B has not commited, transaction A if commit will not result in write skew, transaction B
        will. <br />
