    <h1>SSTable and LSM Trees</h1>
    <div>
        Combination of SSTable and LSM Tree is a design of database engine used in many NoSQL databases.

    <ul>
        <li>Example of a SSTable. It is an appendable only log file, recording a key value relationship with key sorted
        </li>
        <li>
            Multiple SSTables can be merged into one
        </li>
        <li>
            When deleting a key, append a special mark to the end of the file, indicating that the key is deleted, and
            subsequent merge will ignore this key
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Application in NoSQL</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When a write comes in, add it to an in-memory balanced tree data structure (for
            example, a red-black tree). This in-memory tree is sometimes called a memtable.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the memtable gets bigger than some threshold—typically a few megabytes
            —write it out to disk as an SSTable file. Memtable then is emptied.
        </li>
        <li>
            In order to serve a read request, first try to find the key in the memtable, then in
            the most recent on-disk segment, then in the next-older segment, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            A merging and compaction process in the background combine SSTables
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Before writing to a memtable, writing to a different log used for crash recovery. When this memtable is
                flushed to SSTable on disk, the log is discarded</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Subtilties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Query is not efficient if the key doesn't exist. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloon
                filter</a> is an efficient way to check if a key exists and can be applied.
        </li>
    </ul>
